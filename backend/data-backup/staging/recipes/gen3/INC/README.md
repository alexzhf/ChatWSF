## INC
[Intel Neural Compressor](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) IntelÂ® Neural Compressor aims to provide popular model compression techniques such as quantization, pruning (sparsity), distillation, and neural architecture search on mainstream frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, and MXNet, as well as Intel extensions such as Intel Extension for TensorFlow and Intel Extension for PyTorch.  In particular, the tool provides the key features, typical examples, and open collaborations as below:
    
    Support a wide range of Intel hardware such as Intel Xeon Scalable processor, Intel Xeon CPU Max Series, Intel Data Center GPU Flex Series, and Intel Data Center GPU Max Series with extensive testing; support AMD CPU, ARM CPU, and NVidia GPU through ONNX Runtime with limited testing.  
    
    Validate more than 10,000 models such as Bloom-176B, OPT-6.7B, Stable Diffusion, GPT-J, BERT-Large, and ResNet50 from popular model hubs such as Hugging Face, Torch Vision, and ONNX Model Zoo, by leveraging zero-code optimization solution Neural Coder and automatic accuracy-driven quantization strategies

    Collaborate with cloud marketplace such as Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, and Azure, software platforms such as Alibaba Cloud and Tencent TACO, and open AI ecosystem such as Hugging Face, PyTorch, ONNX, and Lightning AI
