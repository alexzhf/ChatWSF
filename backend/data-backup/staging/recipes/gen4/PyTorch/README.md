## PyTorch Software Stack
[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open-source deep learning platform developed by Facebook's artificial intelligence research group. It provides a wide range of algorithms for deep learning, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and reinforcement learning. It also provides efficient tools for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. PyTorch is often used for natural language processing and computer vision tasks.

Pytorch software stack is optimised for building and training of machine learning and deep learning models, e.g. [DLRM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dlrm), ResNet and other such models.
